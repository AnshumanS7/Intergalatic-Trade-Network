# Intergalactic Trade Network

This project designs and implements a **microservices-based architecture** for an Intergalactic Trade Network, managing trade transactions, space cargo, inventory tracking, and real-time updates on trade activities across multiple planets and space stations.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture is built around scalable microservices for efficient handling of different functionalities:

### Components:

- **API Gateway**  
  Routes client requests to the appropriate microservices and handles authentication/authorization.

- **Trade Service**  
  Manages the buying/selling of goods and trade transactions between planets and space stations.

- **Cargo Service**  
  Handles cargo shipments, tracking, and delivery status across the network.

- **Inventory Service**  
  Tracks and updates inventory levels at space stations and planets.

- **Notification Service**  
  Sends real-time notifications for critical events such as delayed shipments and completed trades.

- **Event Processor (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**  
  Processes event-driven data like trade updates, cargo shipment statuses, and notifications.

- **Database Layer (MongoDB)**  
  NoSQL database optimized for high-volume trade, cargo, and inventory data.

- **Real-Time Analytics (WebSocket)**  
  Provides live updates on trade transactions and cargo statuses for the real-time dashboard.

## System Diagram

1. **Client**: Users interact with the system via APIs (mobile or web).
2. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to microservices and handles authentication.
3. **Trade Service**: Processes trade transactions.
4. **Cargo Service**: Manages cargo shipment tracking and status updates.
5. **Inventory Service**: Monitors inventory levels at various space stations.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends alerts for key events such as shipment delays.
7. **Event Processor (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**: Manages events and updates for trades and shipments.
8. **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores trade, cargo, and inventory data.
9. **Real-Time Dashboard**: Displays live updates using WebSocket for real-time insights into trade and cargo activities.
